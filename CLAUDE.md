- Keep line length to maximum 100 characters
- Follow the PEP8 rules for code formatting
- Thi project is managed with Poetry. Add any new dependencies with `poetry add <package>` and run any scripts using `poetry run <command>`
- After executing a command that edits code, check if the test suite still runs. 
- After making significant code changes, check if the test suite needs to be extended or altered. Propose these changes, if needed.
- when dealing with temporary files, always use the tempfile module instead of using the "/tmp" directory
- When dealing with path-like objects, always use the pathlib module
- After making code changes, run `poetry run flake8 nano_api tests` to ensure no PEP 8 violations were introduced, and fix any detected issues.
- When running flake8, always explicitly specify the directories to check, e.g., `flake8 nano_api tests`, to avoid unintended files being checked .
- also run pylint checks with `poetry run pylint nano_api/ tests/` and fix any detected issues.
- run type checking with `poetry run mypy nano_api/` and fix any type-related issues. All functions and methods should have type annotations for input parameters and return values.
- run security analysis with `poetry run bandit -r nano_api/` to check for security vulnerabilities in source code.
